# NLP : Effects of Critic/User Review Language on Movie Perception

## Background
We are interested in the effect that both audience and critic reactions/reviews 
have on the success of a movie release.
 - With more movies being released directly to streaming and fewer being 
    released in theaters, word of mouth reactions have become more critical in evaluating the success of a movie.
    
## Potential Methods:
Sentiment analysis of public reviews and reactions is the most obvious choice 
for approaching our question of interest. 
-  We would likely focus on Rotten Tomatoes reviews for critic reviews 
    since it is the most widely-known and used site for critical reviews 
    
- For user reviews there are many options, including Twitter commentary 
    and reviews left on sites like RT/IMDb/Metacritic.

The sentiment analysis could be cut and compared on different variables 
(e.g. “Top Critics” vs. Not), used to compare to sentiment from other sites, or used in predictive recommendations.

## Potential Questions:
- Critic vs user/public review sentiments in terms of types of language used
- Sentiment of review vs provided score (Predictive models)
  - Language used in review on movies from different platforms, such as Netflix vs Disney, and how they correspond to the critics’ score
- Comparison of scores on different sites using different methods of score calculation
  - I.e. RT uses a binary system, while Metacritic uses a weighted average, but both take in many of the same reviews to produce scores
Movie recommendation model based on the extracted sentiment similarity


## TODOS for team: (thinking we could put items/tasks here for people to do whenever they get the opportunity)
