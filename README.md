# NLP : Effects of Critic/User Review Language on Movie Perception

## Background
We are interested in the effect that both audience and critic reactions/reviews 
have on the success of a movie release.
    - With more movies being released directly to streaming and fewer being 
    released in theaters, word of mouth reactions have become more critical 
    in evaluating the success of a movie.
    
## Potential Methods:
Sentiment analysis of public reviews and reactions is the most obvious choice 
for approaching our question of interest. 
    - We would likely focus on Rotten Tomatoes reviews for critic reviews 
    since it is the most widely-known and used site for critical reviews.
    - For user reviews there are many options, including Twitter commentary 
    and reviews left on sites like RT/IMDb/Metacritic.

The sentiment analysis could be cut and compared on different variables 
(e.g. “Top Critics” vs. Not), used to compare to sentiment from other sites, 
or used in predictive recommendations.
